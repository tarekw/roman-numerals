# roman-numerals

## Description

Roman numberals is a simple React/Redux application written in Typescript. It presents two input boxes, one for converting a number to its roman numeral and another visa versa. The repository also contains a sample server that exposes two REST apis for doing the above mentioned conversions.

## Technologies used

* Typescript, React and Redux for the front end
* Node and express for the back end
* Webpack for building the app for development and production

## Dependencies

* Node 8.x

## Usage

* Navigate to the project folder and enter ```npm install```
* Navigate to the ```./mockServer``` folder and start the server by typing ```node index.js```
* On another terminal, navigate to the project folder and start webpack in dev mode ```npm start```

This should build the project and open the project on the default browser (http://localhost:8080). Project has been tested on Mac/Linux and on Chrome.

## Remaining tasks

* Error handling for front and back end
* Front-end unit testing using Jest
* Front-end end-to-end testing using selenium/webdriver
* Back-end testing using supertest
